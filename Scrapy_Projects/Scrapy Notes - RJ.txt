scrapy genspider example example.com

scrapy crawl myspider

scrapy startproject myproject [project_dir]

That will create a Scrapy project under the project_dir directory. If project_dir wasn’t specified, project_dir will be the same as myproject.

Next, you go inside the new project directory:

cd project_dir

And you’re ready to use the scrapy command to manage and control your project from there.

Controlling projects

You use the scrapy tool from inside your projects to control and manage them.

For example, to create a new spider:

scrapy genspider mydomain mydomain.com
